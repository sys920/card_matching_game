# Requirements
- The game randomly shuffles the cards.
- A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.
- Users should not be able to open more than 2 cards can be open at one time.
- Users should not be able to open a card that is already open or matched.
- A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.
- Upon winning the game, the user should be presented with a SweetAlert alert, indicating that they have won the game.
- A user can restart the game at any time by pressing the restart button. This will cause all the cards to be hidden again.
- The game should display the current number of moves a user has made. A move is considered to have occured 
 when 2 cards have been shown to the user, and either determined to be a match or a non-match.
- Comments should be present in the code and effectively explain a longer code procedure when necessary.
- Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting including proper indentation, thoughtful variable names.
- The game displays a star rating (from 1 to at least 3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game,
it should display at least 3 stars. After some number of moves, it should change to a lower star rating.
- After a few more moves, it should change to a even lower star rating (down to 1). 
- The number of moves needed to change the rating is up to you, but it should happen at some point.
